    I am making a two-dimensional soccer game in the Defold game engine. All of my code is in Lua,
    and I am making good progress. The soccer ball moves using the keys to move, with a dynamic acceleration
    using vector math. Defold's tools allow for the display of each piece, in addition to the rotation of objects
    and changing the value of the score at the top of the screen. My next job is to implement the players, but I
    am not sure how exactly I will do that yet.
