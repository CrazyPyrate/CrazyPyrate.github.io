    <h1>Overview</h1>
    I started by wanting to make a game in Lua. I was not sure of any of the details, but a game sounded very interesting,
    and in the queues assignment, I used Lua as one of the languages. This introduction to Lua changed my mind about the
    "end" keyword. I thought that end would be far less clear than the more common '}' as the end to a loop or if statement.
    I then decided that I liked Lua and wanted to use it more. After I had decided upon a Lua game, I did research into
    game engines that would allow me to work in Lua. I looked at a few, and Defold seemed the least complicated of the
    several options I had seen, while also seeming to have powerful tools. As I started work with Defold, I realized one
    very important thing that I did not see right away. My biggest takeaway from this entire project can be summarized in
    one sentence; an engine is something that augments and language, to remove weaknesses and add strengths.

    <h1>Integration of Course Materials</h1>
    I learned a lot about Lua in this project. Before this course, I don't think I had ever heard of the language Lua. Now,
    though, I feel like I have a very solid grasp on the language. Additionally, going in depth on a new language taught me
    that writability and readability can be different than at first seems, as I was pleasantly surprised by Lua.
    <h1>Technical Complexity</h1>
    If I had to say the one hard thing in this project, it would definitely be the collisions. Trying to create physics that
    work well, even in edge cases was something I put a lot of time into, and at the end of this project, even the basic
    bounces don't work very well. I thought that as soon as I got to the point where I was working out the collisions, it
    would be very easy to figure out how to do it. As I started trying to make it work, it just didn't. I tried many things,
    but none of them produced results that looked consistently good. Besides the mess that I call collisions, I am proud of
    the project. The goals worked well, and message passing was very easy to learn and made sense. Message passing is where
    one object sends a message to another object containing information, and so I just checked for a goal on the ball, then
    it would pass a message to the players that they needed to reset their position and velocity. I don't think this project
    would have been possible without the extremely useful messages.
